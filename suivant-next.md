> Suivant / Next !

"Suivant / Next" is the first impression of Canada I had when I went to Québec in 2022. Specifically, this is the expression of the frontier control, asking the next person to come close. I remember this, partly because that was the first time I stepped on the land of Canada after taking a long international flight. "Suivant" was the French equivalence of "next". Since both English and French are the official language of that country (specially the region), it is the way how a *Québecois* officer speaks.

I am pulling all this from my memory to explain the language choice of this site. As you might have already noticed, I am speaking English while I am not very good at it. You can also safely deduce from my name that I am a Chinese. The fact that I quoted a phrase with a mixture of English and French should tell you that I know *something* about the French. Chinese, English, and French: these are the languages I can speak (with at least a reasonable B2 level); these are the languages I will be using in the blog articles here. Technical articles should be mostly in English and French, and others involving my personal interests should be in Chinese. No translation will be made; if you cannot understand something I write, the [LLM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model) today should be good enough to give a translation.

I apologize in advance for any grammar mistakes that I will make in English and in French. There will be a lot. Any correction will be humbly accepted by sending the errata to my personal [email address](wenhao-luo@outlook.com).
