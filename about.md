This page is built via [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and it is hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Following the [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/about-github-pages-and-jekyll) one can built his own site within minutes with no cost. Therefore it is the way how I built this site.
